\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector of English words to be pluralized}

\item{irregulars}{What level of irregularity to use in pluralization.
\code{"moderate"} uses the most common pluralization.
\code{"conservative"} uses the most common irregular plural if one exists,
even if a regular plural is more common.
\code{"liberal"} uses a regular plural if it exists, even if an irregular
plural is more common.
\code{"none"} attempts to apply regular noun pluralization rules to all words.
Defaults to \code{"moderate"}.
The default can be changed by setting \code{options(plu.irregulars)}.
See examples.}
