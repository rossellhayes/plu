The ENABLE master word list, WORD.LST, is herewith formally
released into the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it or
distribute it in any manner they see fit. No fee or registration
is required for its use nor are "contributions" solicited (if you
feel you absolutely must contribute something for your own peace
of mind, the authors of the ENABLE list ask that you make a
donation on their behalf to your favorite charity). This word
list is our gift to the Scrabble community, as an alternate to
"official" word lists. Game designers may feel free to
incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please mention the
source and credit us as originators of the list. Note that if
you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product, you
may still copyright and protect your product, but you may \emph{not}
legally copyright or in any way restrict redistribution of the
WORD.LST portion of your product. This \emph{may} under law restrict
your rights to restrict your users' rights, but that is only
fair.
